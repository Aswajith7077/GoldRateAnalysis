# Gold Rate Prediction Model

This R script predicts gold rates based on a regression model built using historical data. It provides visualizations and statistical insights into the data, enabling the user to make informed predictions for future gold rates.

## Features

- **Regression Analysis**: Creates a linear regression model to predict gold rates.
- **Visualization**: Plots scatter plots with regression lines for both annual and daily gold rates.
- **Goodness of Fit**: Evaluates the regression model using \(R^2\) and \(p\)-value.
- **User Interaction**: Allows users to input a year and predict the gold rate for that year.
- **Statistical Summary**: Provides a detailed statistical summary of the regression model.

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure the following R packages are installed:

- `ggplot2`: For creating visualizations.
- `readxl`: For reading Excel files.

Install these packages using:

```R
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("readxl")
```

---

## Input Data

### Required Excel Files:
1. **Daily Data File** (`daily_gold_rate.xls`):  
   Contains daily gold rate data with columns:
   - `Year`
   - `INR` (Gold rate in INR)
   - `Date` (Date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format)

2. **Annual Data File** (`annual.xls`):  
   Contains annual gold rate data with columns:
   - `Year`
   - `INR` (Gold rate in INR)
   - `Date` (Date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format)

### File Paths:
Update the file paths in the script to point to the correct location of these files on your system:
```R
daily_data <- read_excel("path_to_daily_gold_rate.xls")
annual_data <- read_excel("path_to_annual.xls")
```

---

## How to Run

1. Open the script in your R editor.
2. Make sure the required Excel files are in the correct paths.
3. Run the script. It will:
   - Read and process the data.
   - Build a regression model.
   - Generate scatter plots with regression lines for daily and annual data.
   - Display the model's goodness of fit and statistical significance.
4. **Interactive Input**:
   - Enter a year to predict the gold rate.
   - Input `0` to exit the interaction.

---

## Output

### Visualizations:
1. **Annual Plot**:
   - Scatter plot with a regression line for annual gold rates.
2. **Daily Plot**:
   - Scatter plot with a regression line for daily gold rates.

### Model Evaluation:
- **Goodness of Fit**:
  - \(R^2\): Measures how well the model explains variance.
  - Decision based on \(R^2\) value.
- **Statistical Significance**:
  - \(p\)-value: Determines the significance of the coefficients.
  - Decision based on \(p\)-value.

### Predictions:
- Predicted gold rate for the entered year.

### Model Summary:
- Complete statistical summary of the regression model.

---

## Example Interaction

1. After running the script, you'll be prompted to enter a year:
   ```
   Enter a Year to predict its value: 2025
   ```
2. The script will return the predicted gold rate:
   ```
   According to the Regression Model
   The Gold Rate might reach â‚¹ 50123.45 at the year of 2025
   ```

3. To exit, enter `0`:
   ```
   Enter a Year to predict its value: 0
   ```

---

## Notes

- Ensure the Excel files contain valid data and proper column names.
- The regression model assumes a linear relationship between the year and the gold rate.
- Dates in the Excel files should be formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
